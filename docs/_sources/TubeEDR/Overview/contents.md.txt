# Re-Organization of 17-19-23 Tube Data EDRs
***
For decades, large chiller product engineers worked hard to bring out a new product design under the guidance of passport process and summarize essential design data into EDR(Engineering data release). 
These EDRs support product design work for a long time, and will continue, yet engineer pioneers starts to find things that is hard to be covered well, since the rapid growth of projects and toolchains, especially in the tube section, which we called 17-19-23 tube EDRs(17-19-23 C / D / G).

***These things are identified as:***
>**1. Uneasy to inspect tube details:**
Those pioneers finds since more and more tubes from different projects are added, it is harder and harder to get tube parameter quickly. Inspection plays important role in performance verification, tube design and selection. Acquiring data from a word or pdf file is not a friendly way.

>**2. Complicate data transfer process:**
Those pioneers finds they need spent additional effort to convert data information from pdf / word EDR files to accessible excel data before putting into digital toolchains to enable modeling and simulation, with a potential risk to give a wrong conversion and cause incorrect performance prediction.

>**3. Exsisted various EDR formats: Those EDR contributor:**
pioneers from function teams-large chiller, small chiller, HT...- finds they owns various data formats, situation becomes worse in tube EDRs which can be used across projects. Pioneers spends extra time to generate different formatted data even from one source, and huge effort to identify the gap between those formats to make sure tubes are used correctly.

Based on the truths - faster and faster tube data inspection, smarter and smarter processes, more and more working groups - are needed, then EDR, especially tube EDRs, stongly desire for an accessible excel format data for all water cooled chiller teams.
