**Requesting Organization: WC chiller platform**
**Operational Owner: Xijia Zhu**
**Project Title: 19MV4 System Design KPI Selection Support**
**Program Name: 550-1100Ton Centrifugal Platform**


**Project Objectives & Benefits** <font color="blue">_(High level summary of what the overall objective is and benefits of executing this work.  To be updated as appropriate)_ </font>

* Execute 1000 Tonnage MV4 KPI selection to support 19MV4 KPI tracking in system design (Also a cross-check with system engineering team).
* Develop KPI selection tool / method which focus intelligently selection of best KPI case, to increase engineering work efficiency.
* Get prepared for improving MV4 KPI selection by data science process / workflow.
* Guide a web-online help system to better present whole workflow.

**Winning Solution/Requirements / KPIs** <font color="blue">_(To be updated as appropriate, add table rows as required)_</font>

Product feature: The key deliverables are to include the following features. 
* Bring out best solution case for 1000Ton KPI selection, which includes R515B and R134a in AHRI conditions for both CLT and Asia region.
* An optimization tool / method based on excel to reach best solution case among thousands of selection cases based on simple heat transfer area comparison in heat exchanger
  * Accurate optimization: Give exact ikw/Ton, WSPD, cost(optional) target, only returns 1 selection.
  * Range optimization: A tolerance on ikw/Ton or WSPD target, returns top 3 selection in different measurement dimension.

The success of this project will be measured: 
1. On time and on quality delivery before 4/14, based on clear inputs ready on 4/4 and on time QA.
2. Execution time for accurate optimization should be less than 30 sec., and range optimization less than 1 min. 
3. Document for recording workflow:
    * Executable website-based workflow help file guidance;
